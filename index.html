      <p>I had watched it an year ago. It is about the boy Hiccup who was born in a family of dragon hunters but he liked dragons so he did not 
        help his family in hunting dragons instead he made friends with a night fury (the strongest of dragons). His family did several attempts
        to kill the night fury but Hiccup helped his dragon and later when the family too starts training dragons and go on adventures with their 
        drangons then Toothless(Hiccup's night fury) helps tham and saves them.
